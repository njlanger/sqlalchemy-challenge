# sqlalchemy-challenge

The code for this assignment was written from what was covered in class. Using ChatGPT as a debugging source.

There are 2 parts to this assignment, part 1, Analyze and explore the climate data, and part 2 was to design a climate app. Part 1 was written using Jupyter notebook and SQLAlchemy and part 2 was done using Visual Studio with Python language. There is separate code for the respective parts of the assignment. The files that house the code are named appropriately. It is best to run the codes separately, part 1 then part 2.
